## Intro

The DB-IP Lite free database is a subset of the full database with reduced coverage and accuracy.

Based on my search and experience, its way better than MaxMind's `GeoLite2 City` and `GeoLite2 Country` database quality in terms of coverage and accuracy.

Cons is the Lite downloads are updated monthly, way lower than MaxMind's update frequency.

Howver, DP-IP didn't provide API key for the Free (lite verison) IP geolocation database download, means you must visit the webpage and click the checkbox of `I agree with the licensing terms`

So, Wrote a Golang program to download it automaticly.
